- Screen registry lives in `source/Private/Navigation/Initialize-BucketNavigation.ps1` and maps 6 screens.
- All registered screens call `Show-BucketHeader` at the top (Figlet header via `Write-SpectreFigletText`).
- Screen-level title is currently handled by `Read-BucketMenu -Title ...` (likely renders a Spectre panel/title), plus additional `Write-SpectreHost` descriptive lines.
- Only live UI pattern currently is `Invoke-SpectreLive` + `New-SpectreLayout` in `source/Private/UI/Show-BucketImageViewer.ps1`.
- Live UI loop pattern: rebuild panels -> `$layout['name'].Update($panel)` -> `$Context.Refresh()` -> `[Console]::ReadKey($true)` dispatch.
- Key handling conventions in live UI: `Escape` exits; `Ctrl+C` exits via `[Console]::TreatControlCAsInput = $true` + checking `$keyInfo.Modifiers`.
